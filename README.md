# Artefacts of Verisimilitudes
An art-installation that will be exhibited at the Open Lab Expo @ Peron-E in Utrecht, Netherlands

Our dreams and realities form a perpetual feedback loop vulnerable to all kinds of external and internal interferences. Residues of dreams seep into our memories as we try to make sense of real world experiences. Are we aware of delusional visions? Let's consciously look at the unconscious, and reveal the flaws in the weaving of our realities.
